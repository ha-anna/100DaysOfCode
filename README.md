# 100DaysOfCode

Today, I will be starting #100DaysOfCode. In the past, I did #100daysofvector and I loved it, so here I go!

For reference, I have been coding for some time now and I want to hold myself accountable and have a written memento of my journey.

---

## Day 1

Today I made a color scheme generator with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and The Color API.

I spend a long time looking at color palettes when making graphics so being able to code it myself felt amazing.

---

## Day 2

Today I learned more about SASS's mixins, the & selector, and functions.

After learning JavaScript, grasping those concepts was pretty easy but interesting nonetheless! I pay a lot of attention to writing DRY code and I believe that incorporating SASS into my coding process will make a big difference. I am looking forward to using it in my next project.

---

## Day 3

Today, I have learnt basics of regular expressions and studied about Async JS and Promises.

Because I come from linguistics background and took a course on computational linguistics in University, the concept of regular expressions was not foreign to me. However, by studying it again I can now apply it when necessary (for example, when I want to check if generated hex colors are valid).

---

## Day 4

Today, I kept working with APIs and finished a War card game project.

It was my first time writing SASS but I have to say I enjoyed it! It looks much cleaner than standard CSS and I truly fell in love with & parent selector.

---

## Day 5

Today I am writing this post pretty late as I keep fighting JavaScript while working on a Movie Watchlist Project.

I have been working on storing items and accessing localStorage. Coding is not always easy and sometimes finding a solution that works takes time. When I encounter such a situation, I try to take a break and come back to the problem later but with a refreshed mind. And usually, it works!

So today, I'd like to remind everyone to take breaks and not be discouraged. If you fall down 7 times, you've got to stand up 8 times!

---

## Day 6

I spent this Sunday learning about local storage, API and SASS while coding the Movie Watchlist project.
I had some moments when I was starting to think I cannot do it but taking a short break and reorganizing my plan helped me thunderously.

---

## Day 7

I've learned how to make a personal dashboard which can be used as a Google Chrome extension today! I used several APIs (Unsplash, Coingecko, Weather) and learned how to get my current position, set time intervals and get the current date. I also practised using my flexbox skills. It was a super fun day. ðŸ˜†

---

## Day 8

Today I continued learning concepts from the Frontend Developer Career Path, namely Flexbox and Grid and practised what I've learned by making 3 different pages (HTML, SASS, JS), a gif of one of which you can see below. I want to use this project to try creating an API and creating an interactive messenger (still working on details). Overall, a great day!

---

## Day 9

Since it's a holiday today I didn't get much studying done, however, I spent time discussing my future projects and read a few chapters of The Tech Resume Inside Out book since I am currently working on improving my CV.
Since it's a day to relax and recharge, I also played the CSS Grid Attack game! Having fun facilitates learning, after all.

---

## Day 10

Wow, I am already done with 10% of this challenge! Today I spent most of my time revising core UI principles and JS concepts. I also watched Scrimba's live stream on Software Testing and learned a bunch of cool things (turns out I am team Test-driven development!).

---

## Day 11

Today I have been working on some JS challenges (jschallenger.com) and continued with Scrimba's Front-end Dev Career Path (currently I am doing module 11: UI design).

---

## Day 12

Today I focused on revising my JavaScript knowledge by doing challenges on JSChallenger and I also spent time refactoring the code of projects I worked on last month.

---

## Day 13

I finished the "Clean Code" course and began reading Robert C. Martin's Clean Code book. I also read 3rd chapter of Aditya Bhargava's book Grokking Algorithms, took notes diligently, and I can finally say I understand recursion and the call stack much better!
As a JS exercise, I completed 3 small challenges (Scrimba's Challenge Week), one of which you can see below as a gif.
Today also marks an important day because I began learning React. Can't wait to make my first static page with React tomorrow!

---

## Day 14

I made my first page with React! Today I learned the basics of React: what JSX is, how to create and organise components, import and export things between files (although I already knew how to do that in JS), how to style my HTML with className, and how to set up my projects locally! I have already begun working on my first solo project (by Scrimba) and will continue working on it tomorrow!

![](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQErDnUiR0GVhw/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1654533002902?e=1661990400&v=beta&t=1yZcDXO-_rX-qy3zaXGGrKMp2PnNVi7538opLtRIb08)

---

## Day 15

Today I completed my first React Solo Project! (link below) After some ups and downs with the deployment of this React app, I finally succeeded and can share it with all of you. After that, I started working on an Airbnb clone and while doing this I learned about props and creating reusable components. React seems really cool and so far I've been enjoying the way it works.

---

## Day 16

Today I completed the second solo #react project and I loved every minute of it! Through this project, I have practised using props, creating reusable components, and destructuring objects. I also got to play around with CSS and made sure the page is responsive and accessible.

---

## Day 17

Phew! Today was a busy day! I started my morning by revising semantic #HTML and accessibility (ARIA, colors, alt text, prefers-reduced-motion, focus indicators) and this led me to revise all of my older projects and improve their accessibility.
After that, I jumped straight back into #React. I began another project, a meme generator and spent my time setting it up, creating #CSS, a custom logo and looking for nice colors to use. Now I am learning about state and the difference between state and props.

---

## Day 18

Due to personal circumstances I had to take half a day off today but I still managed to accomplish some things.

I kept learning about the state, props and components in #react (the image below comes from the project that I am working on while learning about those things).

However, my main focus today was on interacting with the Scrimba community and supporting other students by replying to their inquiries about coding tools, #HTML, #CSS and #JavaScript and reviewing their code. Being a part of a coding community can be really great, you create a bond with people who are on a similar journey to you but also you have a chance to become a teacher and a student at the same time. By helping others solve their code problems, I can learn a lot, reinforce my knowledge, and learn how to explain things to others clearly.

The last thing I will do today is participate in the Scrimba's live-coding event and code a memory game alongside Leanne and Michael. Fun!

---

## Day 19

Today I decided to challenge myself and create a React app on my own, not following any tutorials or lessons.
Since it's been on my mind for some time now, I decided to create an app that will display my CV, allow the viewer to download it as a pdf and switch between languages (2 for now, 3rd is on its way). Through this project, I practised using all of my skills (#HTML, #CSS, #JS, #React) and I loved every minute of it, yet again!

---

## Day 20

I spent the day working on the #CSS of the CV project. I made the page responsive and added a separate CSS for print. It is starting to look really good! I also want to add a function to recognize whether the page is viewed on mobile or desktop so that the download button is functional when on mobile.

---

## Day 21

Today I worked on some animations for Airbnb experiences clone (#react), started working on v.2 of my portfolio, and tried improving my CV project.

I will be travelling across the globe in a few days and things are about to get hectic so I am not sure how much I will be able to code in the upcoming days.

---

## Day 22

Today I deployed the 2nd version of my portfolio, fully designed and coded by me in React. It was not always easy but I enjoyed the process of figuring things out. I wanted to experiment with neubrutalism design while also staying true to myself and using the colors and fonts that represent my personal identity. I made the 1st version of my page 2 months ago, but during that time I have learned so much, it's almost hard to believe. I can't wait to see what I'll be able to do in the future!

---

## Day 23

My focus today was on improving my portfolio's performance. I ran different tests and double-checked headings map, color contrast, and alt tags, viewed my page on tablets, and phones, troubleshot CSS, converted pngs into webps, and converted my font imports into woff.

I also solved some challenges on codewars and reached 7 kyu. Now onto 6 kyu!

Tomorrow is my last day before a long flight, so I don't think I will be able to do much coding.

---

## Day 24

During my flight, I read two chapters of Clean Code and started refactoring #javascript in one of my older projects since I keep thinking that there are too many repetitions in it.

And starting today, I will go back to learning #react and finally finishing the meme generator project!

---

## Day 25

Wohooo, it's been already 25 days which means a big chunk of this challenge is already behind me!

Today I've been learning about conditional rendering, local state, and unified state in #react. Thanks to that I revised if statements, logical and ternary operators! When I started learning React I was a bit worried about whether it would be possible for me to learn it or not but I have to say, I'm having so much fun now. Every day I look forward to what I will be able to do next. :)

---

## Day 26

Since today is the first day of #ScrimbaChallengeWeek, I decided to also participate and get some #JavaScript practice! It's always a great opportunity to see solutions from other learners and learn a thing or two.

I also learned the basics of forms in #react and updated my links and resources repo (you can find it here: [Github Repo](https://github.com/its-haanna/links-and-resources)).

![](https://media-exp1.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D22AQE7TmwPVOeEQA/feedshare-shrink_800/0/1655766019926?e=1663804800&v=beta&t=Tu1NMthLuiOQdj2bkS-ohoEBOKQvOy5xIg5gSvDu8Sw)

I also solved some challenges on codewars and reached 7 kyu. Now onto 6 kyu!

Tomorrow is my last day before a long flight, so I don't think I will be able to do much coding.

---

## Day 27

I had a remarkable day today! Why? I completed my first code review and it was an amazing experience. Scrimba really knows what they are doing by teaching us how to do it and encouraging it.

Other than that, I continued learning about forms in #react, attended Scrimba's town hall meeting and participated in the 2nd day of Weekly Challenge. You can check out what I made live here: [Live Page](https://codepen.io/haanna/pen/LYQKYEp)

---

## Day 28

Today I coded another Scrimba Weekly Challenge project! I added custom animations, tweaked CSS and added a surprise for some lucky (or maybe unlucky) person.

I also studied more about forms in #react, started working on the meme generator again and updated my cv page to display complete information in Korean.

---

## Day 29

Another day, another Scrimba Weekly Challenge! One more left to go.

Today, I learned about useEffect in #react, fixed some typos and small issues in my older projects, and helped other students of Scrimba community. Tomorrow I should finally complete the meme generator!

---

## Day 30

Today I have finally finished the meme generator project in #react! I've also completed the last challenge of Scrimba Challenge Week.

Starting tomorrow, I will take a week-long break from posting. I plan to spend the upcoming week with my family and rest in nature with no wifi and some books.

---

## Day 31

I am back! I have recharged my batteries and I am ready to get back into more intense coding again.

I've been watching Harvard's CS50 lectures and today I've finished the 2nd one, the one about C. I can now see where JavaScript got its syntax from.
Other than that, I've been reviewing code and helping other students and replying to their questions. A bit of a lazy day but I've learned new things nonetheless.
